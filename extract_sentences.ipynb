    "In this notebook we will try to extract the different sentences in the corpora. Note that it can be very difficult because a sentence in french can be related to two or many sentences in wolof and some sentences are moved from their right places. It will require to take in account some options in order to manually select the related sentences between the French corpus and the Wolof corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will look at the semantic of a french sentence to select the different related Wolof sentences. \n",
    "- If the french sentence is not related to any wolof sentence we will skip its selection.\n",
    "- If a french sentence is not totally describe by a wolof sentence we will search the rest of the semantic in the next wolof sentences until completing it. And vice versa for a wolof sentence. \n",
    "- If a sentence contains an expression beginning with \"«\" or \"(\" and not being closed then the found sentence is not a true one and we must concatenated it with the next sentence. The same is done when the expression is closed but doesn't have a beginning but at this time we concatenated it with the previous sentence.  \n",
    "- It will require that the translation to be as correct as possible.\n",

      "3: Le corps nu de cette femme, fait de plis, de rides, sa peau comme une outre dégonflée, ses seins allongés et flasques, pendant sur son ventre, sa peau craquelée, ternie, un peu grise, tout cela me semble étrange, et  en même temps vrai.\n",

      "6: Et non la réponse – sans doute rassurante, peut-être un peu gênée – de ma mère : « Non, elle n’est pas malade, elle est vieille, c’est tout. » La vieillesse, sans doute plus choquante pour un enfant sur le corps d’une femme puisque encore, puisque toujours, en France, en Europe, pays des gaines et des jupons, des soutiens-gorge et des combinaisons, les femmes sont ordinairement exemptes de la maladie de l’âge.\n",
      "7: La brûlure sur mes joues que je ressens encore, qui accompagne la question naïve et la réponse brutale de ma mère, comme un soufflet.\n",
      "8: Cela est resté en moi sans réponse.\n",

      "Parmi tous ceux qui se pressent autour de moi, il y a une vieille femme, enfin je ne sais pas qu’elle est vieille. Je suppose que c’est d’abord son âge que je remarque, parce qu’elle diffère des enfants nus et des hommes et des femmes habillés plus ou moins à l’occidentale que je vois à Ogoja.\n",
      "Quand ma mère revient (peut-être vaguement inquiète de ce rassemblement), je lui montre cette femme : « Qu’est-ce qu’elle a ? Est-ce qu’elle est malade ? » Je me souviens de cette question que j’ai posée à ma mère. Le corps nu de cette femme, fait de plis, de rides, sa peau comme une outre dégonflée, ses seins allongés et flasques, pendant sur son ventre, sa peau craquelée, ternie, un peu grise, tout cela me semble étrange, et  en même temps vrai.\n",
      "Comment aurais-je pu imaginer que cette femme était ma grand-mère ? Et je ressentais non pas de l’horreur ni de la pitié, mais au contraire de l’amour et de l’intérêt, ceux que suscite la vue de la vérité, de la réalité vécue.\n",
      "Je me rappelle seulement cette question : « Est-ce qu’elle est malade ?» Elle me brûle encore aujourd’hui étrangement, comme si le temps n’était pas passé.\n",
      "Et non la réponse – sans doute rassurante, peut-être un peu gênée – de ma mère : « Non, elle n’est pas malade, elle est vieille, c’est tout. » La vieillesse, sans doute plus choquante pour un enfant sur le corps d’une femme puisque encore, puisque toujours, en France, en Europe, pays des gaines et des jupons, des soutiens-gorge et des combinaisons, les femmes sont ordinairement exemptes de la maladie de l’âge. La brûlure sur mes joues que je ressens encore, qui accompagne la question naïve et la réponse brutale de ma mère, comme un soufflet. Cela est resté en moi sans réponse.  La question n’était sans doute pas : Pourquoi cette femme est-elle devenue ainsi, usée et déformée par la vieillesse ?, mais : Pourquoi m’a-t-on menti ? Pourquoi m’a-t-on caché cette vérité ?\n",
