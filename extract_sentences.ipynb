    "In this notebook we will try to extract the different sentences in the corpora. Note that it can be very difficult because a sentence in french can be related to two or many sentences in wolof and some sentences are moved from their right places. It will require to take in account some options in order to manually select the related sentences between the French corpus and the Wolof corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will look at the semantic of a french sentence to select the different related Wolof sentences. \n",
    "- If the french sentence is not related to any wolof sentence we will skip its selection.\n",
    "- If a french sentence is not totally describe by a wolof sentence we will search the rest of the semantic in the next wolof sentences until completing it. And vice versa for a wolof sentence. \n",
    "- If a sentence contains an expression beginning with \"«\" or \"(\" and not being closed then the found sentence is not a true one and we must concatenated it with the next sentence. The same is done when the expression is closed but doesn't have a beginning but at this time we concatenated it with the previous sentence.  \n",
    "- It will require that the translation to be as correct as possible.\n",

      "3: Le corps nu de cette femme, fait de plis, de rides, sa peau comme une outre dégonflée, ses seins allongés et flasques, pendant sur son ventre, sa peau craquelée, ternie, un peu grise, tout cela me semble étrange, et  en même temps vrai.\n",

      "6: Et non la réponse – sans doute rassurante, peut-être un peu gênée – de ma mère : « Non, elle n’est pas malade, elle est vieille, c’est tout. » La vieillesse, sans doute plus choquante pour un enfant sur le corps d’une femme puisque encore, puisque toujours, en France, en Europe, pays des gaines et des jupons, des soutiens-gorge et des combinaisons, les femmes sont ordinairement exemptes de la maladie de l’âge.\n",
      "7: La brûlure sur mes joues que je ressens encore, qui accompagne la question naïve et la réponse brutale de ma mère, comme un soufflet.\n",
      "8: Cela est resté en moi sans réponse.\n",

      "Parmi tous ceux qui se pressent autour de moi, il y a une vieille femme, enfin je ne sais pas qu’elle est vieille. Je suppose que c’est d’abord son âge que je remarque, parce qu’elle diffère des enfants nus et des hommes et des femmes habillés plus ou moins à l’occidentale que je vois à Ogoja.\n",
      "Quand ma mère revient (peut-être vaguement inquiète de ce rassemblement), je lui montre cette femme : « Qu’est-ce qu’elle a ? Est-ce qu’elle est malade ? » Je me souviens de cette question que j’ai posée à ma mère. Le corps nu de cette femme, fait de plis, de rides, sa peau comme une outre dégonflée, ses seins allongés et flasques, pendant sur son ventre, sa peau craquelée, ternie, un peu grise, tout cela me semble étrange, et  en même temps vrai.\n",
      "Comment aurais-je pu imaginer que cette femme était ma grand-mère ? Et je ressentais non pas de l’horreur ni de la pitié, mais au contraire de l’amour et de l’intérêt, ceux que suscite la vue de la vérité, de la réalité vécue.\n",
      "Je me rappelle seulement cette question : « Est-ce qu’elle est malade ?» Elle me brûle encore aujourd’hui étrangement, comme si le temps n’était pas passé.\n",
      "Et non la réponse – sans doute rassurante, peut-être un peu gênée – de ma mère : « Non, elle n’est pas malade, elle est vieille, c’est tout. » La vieillesse, sans doute plus choquante pour un enfant sur le corps d’une femme puisque encore, puisque toujours, en France, en Europe, pays des gaines et des jupons, des soutiens-gorge et des combinaisons, les femmes sont ordinairement exemptes de la maladie de l’âge. La brûlure sur mes joues que je ressens encore, qui accompagne la question naïve et la réponse brutale de ma mère, comme un soufflet. Cela est resté en moi sans réponse.  La question n’était sans doute pas : Pourquoi cette femme est-elle devenue ainsi, usée et déformée par la vieillesse ?, mais : Pourquoi m’a-t-on menti ? Pourquoi m’a-t-on caché cette vérité ?\n",

      "0: C’est à Bamenda que mon père emmène ma mère après leur mariage, et Forestry House est leur première maison.\n",
      "1: Ils installent leurs meubles, les seuls meubles qu’ils ont jamais achetés et qu’ils emporteront avec eux partout : des tables, des fauteuils taillés dans des troncs d’iroko, décorés de sculptures traditionnelles des hauts plateaux de l’Ouest camerounais, léopards, singes, antilopes.\n",
      "2: La photo que mon père prend de leur salon à Forestry House montre un décor très « colonial » : au-dessus du manteau de la cheminée (il fait froid à Bamenda en hiver) est accroché un grand bouclier en peau d’hippopotame, assorti de deux lances croisées.\n",
      "3: Il s’agit vraisemblablement d’objets laissés là par un précédent occupant, car cela ne ressemble pas à ce que mon père pouvait rechercher.\n",
      "4: Les meubles sculptés, en revanche, l’ont accompagné jusqu’en France.\n",
      "5: J’ai passé une grande partie de mon enfance et de mon adolescence au milieu de ces meubles, assis sur les tabourets pour y lire les dictionnaires.\n",
      "6: J’ai joué avec les statues d’ébène, avec les sonnettes de bronze, j’ai utilisé les cauris en guise d’osselets.\n",
      "7: Pour moi, ces objets, ces bois sculptés et ces masques accrochés aux murs n’étaient pas du tout exotiques.\n",
      "8: Ils étaient ma part africaine, ils prolongeaient ma vie et, d’une certaine façon, ils l’expliquaient.\n",
      "9: Et avant ma vie, ils parlaient du temps que mon père et ma mère avaient vécu là-bas, dans cet autre monde où ils avaient été heureux.\n",
      "10: Comment dire ?\n",
      "11:  J’ai ressenti de l’étonnement, et même de l’indignation, lorsque j’ai découvert, longtemps après, que de tels objets pouvaient être achetés et exposés par des gens qui n’avaient rien connu de tout cela, pour qui ils ne signifiaient rien, et même pis, pour qui ces masques, ces statues et ces trônes n’étaient pas des choses vivantes, mais la peau morte qu’on appelle souvent l’« art ».\n",
